# Project Euler

Project Euler is a series of challenging mathematical/computer programming problems that require mathematical insights and programming skills to solve.

In this repository my solutions to Project Euler problems will be stored.
Do not look at a problem's solution if you have not already solved the problem yourself!

My **solutions are implemented in Javascript**, as gaining proficiency in Javascript is my goal.
